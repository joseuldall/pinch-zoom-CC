            <h3>Emma Talbot</h3>
            <h4>Are you a living thing that is dying, or a dying thing that is living?</h4>
            <h5>Opening the spring season, CC presents the first major Scandinavian solo exhibition by British artist Emma Talbot (f. 1969) featuring both new and existing works. Exploring themes of rebirth, transformation, sustainability and human resilience amid systemic ecological collapse the exhibition reflects on lifes cyclical nature and poses the question: Are you a living thing that is dying, or a dying thing that is living?
              <br><br>
              Rendered in captivating palettes of deep purples, rusty ochres, soft pinks, and bright greens, Talbots painterly surfaces are inhabited by ethereal, human-like figures and personified animals navigating uncharted landscapes. From these entangled cosmoses, Talbot challenges viewers to deepen their connection with the earth and reconsider their place in an interconnected universe, suggesting that human survival may rely on harmonizing with natures timeless, self-sustaining cycles.
              <br><br>
              Comprising drawing, large-scale silk paintings, three-dimensional objects and animation Talbots work bridges the personal and the universal. By combining autobiography, memory, psychological projections, feminist theory, ecopolitics and storytelling with introspective explorations of the artists personal thoughts, emotions, and self-narratives, Talbot engages in asking pertinent questions about our ever-changing world  not least about humanitys relationship with nature and the environment.</h5>
